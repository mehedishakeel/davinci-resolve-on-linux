# DaVinci Resolve Installer for Omarchy (Arch Linux + Hyprland + NVIDIA)
#
# DaVinci Resolve is a professional video editing suite by Blackmagic Design.
# It's distributed as a self-extracting AppImage-style .run file inside a ZIP.
# This script automates the entire installation process on Omarchy, handling
# all the quirks and workarounds needed to get Resolve running on Arch Linux.
#
# Why this script exists:
#   Resolve is built for CentOS/RHEL and bundles its own versions of many
#   libraries. On Arch Linux, some of these bundled libraries conflict with
#   system libraries (especially glib), while others (libc++, libc++abi)
#   MUST be kept because Resolve was compiled against specific ABI versions.
#   Getting this balance right is tricky — this script handles it automatically.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. Finds the Resolve ZIP in ~/Downloads/
#   2. Installs system dependencies (codecs, GPU libs, legacy compat libs)
#   3. Extracts the ZIP → .run → squashfs-root (AppImage payload)
#   4. Replaces bundled glib/gio/gmodule with system versions (ABI-safe)
#   5. Keeps vendor libc++/libc++abi (removing these breaks Resolve)
#   6. Installs to /opt/resolve with RPATH patching for all ELF binaries
#   7. Ensures legacy libcrypt.so.1 is available (Arch dropped it)
#   8. Installs desktop entries, icons, and udev rules
#   9. Creates an XWayland wrapper script for Hyprland compatibility
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Omarchy (Arch Linux) with NVIDIA drivers installed and working
#   - DaVinci Resolve Linux ZIP downloaded to ~/Downloads/
#   - Internet connection (for installing packages)

#   libarchive:         Archive handling library (dependency for extraction)
#   xdg-user-dirs:      Ensures standard user directories exist (~/Downloads, etc.)
#   desktop-file-utils: Provides update-desktop-database for app menu integration
#   file:               Identifies file types (used to find ELF binaries for patching)

#   glu:                OpenGL Utility Library (3D rendering support)
#   gtk2:               GTK2 toolkit (Resolve's UI uses some GTK2 components)
#   fuse2:              Filesystem in Userspace v2 (for AppImage compatibility)
#
# IMPORTANT: We deliberately do NOT replace Resolve's bundled libc++/libc++abi
# with system versions. Resolve was compiled against specific C++ ABI versions
# and swapping them causes crashes. Only glib/gio/gmodule get replaced (later).

# ==================== ABI-Safe Library Replacement ====================
#
# This is the most delicate part of the install. Resolve bundles its own

#
# REPLACE with system versions (these are safe to swap):
#   - libglib-2.0.so.0    — GLib core library
#   - libgio-2.0.so.0     — GLib I/O library
#   - libgmodule-2.0.so.0 — GLib module loading
#   These are stable C libraries with a very consistent ABI.
#
# KEEP bundled versions (replacing these breaks Resolve):
#   - libc++.so           — C++ standard library (LLVM)
#   - libc++abi.so         — C++ ABI support library
#   Resolve was compiled with a specific libc++ version. Using the system
#   version causes ABI mismatches and immediate crashes.

# We patch EVERY ELF binary (executables and shared objects) to search
# /opt/resolve/libs/ and all its subdirectories. This includes large files
# like libQt5WebEngineCore.so (~200MB) — skipping them causes "library not
# found" errors because they link to other Resolve libs.
#
# This step can take a minute or two due to the number of files.

# ==================== snd-aloop (the actual render-blocker fix) ====================
#
# Resolve's audio engine opens raw ALSA hardware via snd_pcm_open("hw:%d", ...)
# — it never goes through ALSA's plugin layer (default/pulse/pipewire) and it
# enumerates EVERY card under /dev/snd/controlC[0-32] looking for a usable PCM.
# When every real ALSA card on the system is owned/contested by PipeWire's
# session manager, Resolve's enumeration loops forever, the render queue
# never spawns the encoder, and the user sees:
#   - alsa device meters "flickering" in wireplumber (each enumeration cycle
#     briefly opens controlC*; PipeWire reacts)
#   - render that "won't start" with no error in ResolveDebug.txt
# Confirmed via strace: 14000+ SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_PCM_INFO ENXIO ioctls and
# 47000+ /dev/snd/controlCN ENOENT opens during the failed render attempt,
# concentrated AFTER the user clicks Render — i.e. a tight retry loop.
#
# THE FIX: load the kernel's snd-aloop module. It exposes a virtual ALSA
# loopback card that PipeWire ignores (no ACP profile, not auto-acquired).
# Resolve's enumerator finds it, can fully own it, settles on it, and the
# render proceeds. Side effect: a "Loopback" device shows up in alsamixer
# and pavucontrol — harmless.
